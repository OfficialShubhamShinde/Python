"""
    1) here regular if else statement is so big but readable
    2) there are more ways to write if else statemet:
    for ex:
"""

# Regular way
x = 20
if x == 20:
    print("(regular) 20 is 20")
else:
    print("(regular) 20 is not 20")

# Short hand
# Way 1:
if x < 28: print("(Way 1)your x(20) is Smaller than 28")
# Way 2:
print("(way 2) x is my b date") if x==20 else print("(way 2) x is not my b date")
